&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time to see how much of a monster you really are.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep, Minion is finally here. The file size is 1.2 meg, not too bad considering that includes three maps, two new monsters, and a tutorial demo.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So click on the headline to download. Follow these instructions for a quick and easy start:<P>

1. Make sure the Minion pak file is in c:\quake\minion subdirectory<BR>
2. Run with the Quake command line:<BR>
c:\quake\quake -game minion<BR>
3. Start a single player game<BR>
4. Touch your minion pieces to morph into a monster<BR>
5. Choose a monster enemy and touch him to fight<BR>
6. The loser of that battle gets his piece eliminated<BR>
7. Set pieces down on orbs to gain magic in each round<BR>
8. Battle until you've eliminated all enemy minions or until yours are gone<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, everything you need -- skill settings, help screens, and more -- are in the menu. The menu is the heart of the game. Explore the menu. Use the menu often. I cannot stress that enough, especially to those of you who don't like to pay attention.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minion did turn out well; however, this is the very first version, and there might be bugs. Please send any reports, comments or criticisms to <a href="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com">coffee@planetquake.com</A>. I'd like to hear from you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope you all enjoy it. Thanks for your patience. I'll talk to you soon.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=+2><b>M</b></FONT><FONT size=+1>inion is the battle chess game with a little strategy and a heap of action. Become one of ten morphs and fight clever monster bots. Use magic, weapons, and your brain all in one game.<P></FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would win in a fight between an ogre and a fiend?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Minion, the new single player deathsport, you can morph into either during one game. You see, the action starts at a chessboard, where you have a certain number of pieces, your morphs. On the other side rest the enemy pieces, the monsters.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each piece has strengths and weaknesses, attacks and immunities. You must decide which of your pieces are good against each of the enemies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say you choose to become your shambler and you select the enforcer as an opponent. The action moves to the battle area, where you try to frag your foe.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, you chose wisely. As an electrical monster, the shambler is immune to the enforcers' laser. You can use your lightning to fry him. Or you can try your self-teleporter to telefrag him.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And theirein lies the nature of Minion, combining opponents to create unpredictable battle situations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get killed though, you are transported back to the chessboard. Your shambler is gone, and you must select another piece. If you had fragged him, the enforcer piece would be removed from the board.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tournament lasts until one of you runs out of pieces. Or courage.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, monsters are not supposed to feel fear. It's time to find out how much of a monster you really are.<P>
