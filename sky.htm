&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=4>The first deathmatch sport made exclusively for single players has arrived. In SkyBlazer you try to carry a ball into a goal while riding a hoverboard.<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bots do too.<P></FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, in this team sport, the bots will carry the ball, escort their teammates, even play decoy as they attempt to score goals. And they <B>don't</B> use waypoints, so you can play on any decent deathmatch map.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can give your bot teammates orders like advance, camp, or escort, and they'll listen; they won't just wander around.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, you're able to place the goal manually where you like it. The bots will find it on many different maps.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bots will run around you, maneuver for a better shot, and use new weapons like the Mind Scrambler on you. They'll make decisions on the spot: sometimes they'll go straight for the goal, sometimes they'll try to kill you first, and other times they'll run interference for their mates.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, don't merely listen to me. Check out the <A HREF="sky.txt">readme.txt file</A> for details. Or ust download the 940K file, load up your favorite deathmatch map, and blaze the sky.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the only lag is in your trigger finger.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=4>I've always wished I could play games like LavaBall and QSoccer, but lag has stopped me. That's why I think SkyBlazer is my best project yet. However, it contains no maps.<P></FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, that sucks. I'm no map designer. I wish it could have maps of its own. I <B>strongly</B> recommend downloading one of these or any other bot-friendly maps.<P>


	<A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/fragtown/FragDnl2.html">
	The Fragtown Series</A>
	A great selected of levels with a rich city environment.
	Since these are tall and open maps, they're very recommended.<P>

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/planetquake/ramshackle/ultrav.zip">
	UltraViolence</A>
	A small map with a great Egyptian feel. New textures and deep atmosphere<P>

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/planetquake/ramshackle/ztndm4.zip">
	The Steeler</A> A great space base. One of the best DM maps around, period. What more can I say.<P>

	<A HREF="http://planetquake.com/ramshackle/ztndm5.zip">
	Painkiller</A> Another one of the best DM maps around, wonderful game flow, superb archtecture. The bots love this one.<P>

	<A HREF="http://planetquake.com/ramshackle/ztndm4.zip">
	Deathmatch Arenas</A> Four maps with different themes including temple,	gothic, even Doom style. DMA2 is especially recommended.<P>

10. Bots on hoverboards aren't something you see everyday.<P>
9. With your retarded modem, you pulled the trigger yesterday, and the rocket still hasn't made it across the room.<P>
8. You are still sore from the last time you tried to use a surf board in mid-air.<P>
7. When you order your dog to get your slippers, he just lifts his leg. But when you order a SkyBlazer bot to meet you at the rendezvous point, he says '"No sweat. I'll give you a head start."<P>
6. This isn't Quake 1. This isn't Quake 2. This is SkyBlazer.<P>
5. It's like soccer with nailguns and no gravity. Enough said.<P>
4. These bots are so graceful in battle that John Woo wants them to star in his next movie.<P>
3. Riding a hoverboard will get you higher than sniffing glue.<P>
2. You can play it on any good deathmatch level. You'll wish you could play it in any room in your house.<P>
1. You don't have to worry about your connection being slow. Just you're trigger finger.<P>
