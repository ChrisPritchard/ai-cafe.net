&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I get back into the habit of updating the Cafe, you'll see me tring some new features. One of these is the "Cool Picks" column on the right. You see, I just eat up entertainment. For instance, I buy a new game about every other week. I get a new music CD every week. I see about two movies a week. In addition, I read countless magazines and books.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I figured, why consume all that multimedia without sharing some of the highlights with you? I like just about every type of music, especially electronica and ambient, I love Honk Kong action cinema, and I'm into gothic games. If any of these interest you then maybe you'll find a worthy recommendation.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the Quake front, I'm looking for playtesters for my new mod, code-named "Ballz" (it's a funny, light-hearted game influenced by Nerf). If you're curious, email me at <A HREF="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com">coffee@planetquake.com</A>. I'd like to get some feedback on this before I release it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And please, if anything on this page looks funky to you, let me know through a quick email or IQC message. Thanks.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my summer vacation is over.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will be my excuse for not updating in so long. It's now back-to-school season, so I figured it is a fitting time to return to the cafe. And you can return to QuakeC school with the new <A HREF="tutorial/enviro.htm">Environmental Damage Tutorial</A> written by Rabies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you could guess, the future of the cafe is up in the air. Oh, I'll keep it around for reference material and Quake newbies. But as for new content, well, I don't know where to take it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in the process of shopping for a new PC. After buying one, I was thinking of switching to Unreal Tournament or even Quake 3 Team Arena. We'll see though.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of course, I'd love to finish all these damn unfinished Quake 1 mods lying around my hard drive ...<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell you something, Quake is one lively dead parrot.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah yeah yeah, there are fewer Q1 sites now, and people visit these sites less regularly, and there are fewer posts on the message board, and so on and so forth. But that does not and cannot change one simple fact: <A HREF="http://www.crosswinds.net/~noricoco/neurotic-homepage.htm">Quakebility</A> and <A HREF="http://www.mdqnet.net/electro/Q1arena/main.html">Quake 1 Arena</A> are two of the best mods ever made for this game.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the first two mods to seriously interest me in a year. I've been playing them a good deal. Both add a breath of fresh rocket smoke into Q1. Both make the game feel new, which is the best thing a mod can do.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So which offers a better arena experience? Quakability gets a lot of points for presentation and personality, but loses some of those points for its tedious installation. Q1A is easy to get into and possesses great sounds. Yet it is begging for its own new weapon models.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But are these mods actually competing with each other? I say hell no: download both of these bad boys! And you should note that I don't often use exclamation points, so you know something good is going on here.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have been coding.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels kind of strange, too, you know, doing something productive. I've been trying to complete my mod <B>Run</B>, and I'm actually making good progress.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Run is a soccer-type mod with close-range weapons. Recently I have included more weapons, more features, and more maps. Indeed, I'd like to finish enough levels so the mod can have a tournament mode in which you would unlock the next map by beating the current one. We'll see, though.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my fit of inexplicable productivity, I also managed to write a tutorial (no, I have not been replaced with a coffee clone). This one will give you a neat <A HREF="tutorial/rand_wep.htm">random weapon feature</A> for maps.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, I'm going to be completely unoriginal for this update: I am still considering releasing one (or more) of my incomplete mods, since I have so many of them, and since I can't seem to finish the damn things.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, I have <B>Run</B>, a bot team sport based on melee weapons and soccer-like gameplay. I realized that I created a good number of maps for it, so it would be foolish of me not to do something with it. We'll see.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course I have also been wondering about the fate of Tutor Bot and his <B>BotBall</B> mod. I think there is some good potential there, again, if I ever complete it. What do you think about these? Tell me what you think in the <A HREF="http://minion.planetquake.gamespy.com/ubb/forumdisplay.cgi?action=topics&amp;forum=Tutor+Bot&amp;number=1&amp;DaysPrune=&amp;LastLogin=">Tutor Bot</A> forum.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have much for you today, just trying to keep in the habit of updating. In actuality, I've been -- yikes! -- coding. When things take more shape, I'll post some real news.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I did want to say that if you have a bot, a mod, a patch, or a Quake site which you'd like to see mentioned on the AI Cafe, just send me some email at <A HREF="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com">coffee@planetquake.com</A>. True, I'm not a news site -- and I am slow with email, yet I really enjoy posting information about any Quake mod on this page.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed I would like to feature your project on my front page. Any publicity for Quake is good for all of us.<P>

		<TD BGCOLOR="46008C"><B>Source Code 'n Stuff</B></TD>
		<TD WIDTH=20% ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR="7700EE"><B>April<BR>1</B></TD>
	</TR></TABLE><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most common types of email I get is requests for source code. My mods were always a little bit rough around the edges, and many guys have asked me if they could have the code to make improvements and such.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I'm an unorganized person. Since I always felt that my mods were incomplete, I had a bad habit of altering the source code right after release. For example, I immediately began Minion Arena 2 with the MA code -- before backing it up.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words all of my code (including the source to my mods <B>Run</B> and <B>Quake Tac Toe</B>) is in development, so it's not of much use to many people. However, I did scour my hard drive and came up with some <A HREF="files/sky_src.zip">source code to SkyBlazer</A>. This is not directly from the mod itself; it may not even compile properly, and it's very old and undocumented. But if you are looking for a few AI ideas, you can peruse it to your liking.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I had more source code to give you. In fact, this is why I came up with the idea for <B>BotBall</B>, so we could build a mod together here at the site. Speaking of that mod, work is going slow but well. The project will feature a city map, a tech map, a Quake 3-styled map, and more. Check back later for more news.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more note: the AI Cafe has just become an Allied Site of Inside3D. In case you didn't know (and I wouldn't admit it to anyone if you didn't), this is one of the finest tutorial sites out there, and it's where I learned QuakeC. Go there now, or I will come after you.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another cycle has happened again. Real life has kicked me around once more. I won't bore you with the details; suffice it to say major personal strife has kept me too preoccupied to code or update. I apologize. I won't ever give up, though.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright, enough of that crap. It is true that our esteemed Tutor Bot is getting older, yet he is still being implemented into mods, like Quakability and Quake 2000. I still receive email and new ICQ contacts from guys who have <I>just</I> discovered my site. This makes me quite happy.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus I am continuing the tutorial series (today's is on alternative <A HREF="tutorial/walkmove.htm">walkmove navigation</A>). However, the series will soon take on a whole new direction.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the near future, these lessons will focus solely on the Tutor Bot sport, <B>BotBall</B>. The following paragraphs -- the first details on this upcoming mod -- are rough excerpts from the readme.txt file ...<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear the roar of the crowd.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You clutch the ball in your hands.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You run hard toward the goal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel the impact of a rocket.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Project Botball. This one-on-one sport puts you in an arena with a bot, a ball, and a goal. Your job is to catch the ball and run it into the goal. However, that is the bot's job as well, and he will try his hardest to kill you and score that point himself.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of it as football with big guns. You will have special weapons and entities at your disposal to help you score points. The emphasis is on running, yet you may not be able to run straight at the goal. The bot may be there with a rocket launcher, waiting for you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create an opponent of random skill, type impulse 100. To create a foe of skill one through five, enter impulse 101 to 105 respectively. The playing fields are small and simple, thus you will only be allowed to spawn one bot.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may set the console variables "fraglimit" and "timelimit" to give your matches an end. Botball possesses a built-in tournament mode: when you reach one of these limits, the game will load the next map with a bot of increased difficulty.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So crack your knuckles. Stretch your legs. Load your shotgun. Have a ball.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it seems like Botball's gameplay and levels are simple, that's because they are. Consider it the Tutor Mod.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Tutor Bot, Project Botball was designed with simplicity in mind. The Tutor Bot came in one file, and thus it was easy to edit or add to your mod. This project was kept simple so that you could add Botball support to your bot in few quick steps. Or you could understand the source code and edit it easily.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this project is for you to learn how to create a mod from the ground up. You can now see how a mod works, from creating custom map entities and forming gameplay rules to writing objective-based AI.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules, the entities, and the levels are all bot-friendly; you don't have to worry about navigation, you can just concentrate on making your bot better at the game or modifying the game itself.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Botball was meant to be plain, again similar to the Tutor Bot. In other words, it is a blank slate, with much room left for improvement. Change what you want. This project could be transformed into anything from a team sport featuring melee weapons to a King of the Hill-type game with no ball.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will notice that each of the levels has extra entities. Theses are there for expandability; you may need them for your particular modification.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, you can take the Botball map specifications and design your own playing fields. Just like the gameplay, the maps are also straight-forward. Thus, the average map designer could make a Botball level in a day or two. Then he could email it to me so that all the other users could download it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I envision a pool of Botball resources, from new models and maps to different modes and improved AI, all available at the AI Cafe website. Moreover, the page will feature a series of project tutorials, starting with adding Botball support to your bot then moving to adding new gameplay modes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning how to program QuakeC was cool. Learning how to create a deathmatch bot was cooler. Now I think learning how to build your own mod will be the coolest.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, I do have some fairly significant news: I've been coding. In fact, I hope to post the first build of my new mod this weekend. If all goes well, I will make an announcement on its release soon. Stay tuned.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having spent about three years compiling it, my ICQ contact list had about 125 names of fellow Quakers on it. That was my digital social circle. There was always someone online.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being the screwhead that I am, I went poking around where I shouldn't have and -- poof! -- that list disappears. In five seconds it was gone. Should've stuck with QuakeC.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did manage to collect several numbers again. You may have noticed my request to be on your list. If you can, please send me a short message so I can find the rest of you. And for those of you who haven't added me yet, my UIN is <B>2716002</B>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the dawn of the year 2000 came and went and the world did not end. And I thought Ricky Martin was a dead ringer for the Anti-Christ.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope your New Year's Eve was enjoyable as mine. My woman and I got a hotel room, attended a party in the grand ballroom, drank champagne at midnight, even ran through the hallways with a hundred helium balloons.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I wish I could blame the Y2K bug for my lapse in updates, but I can't. These were my busiest holidays ever, so I just haven't been able to get to the computer. Yet I have written a few lessons, including one for today. So those of you who wish my site would just die already will have to wait another millenium.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, Quake has received a kick in the ass from the release of the engine source code. I can't even imagine what this might mean, but it will sure be good. And yes, there are a couple new Quake mods that have started development recently. That is nothing short of amazing.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of these new projects feature a Quake 3 Arena tournament-style play with a bot ladder and all. Because of the interest in this kind of thing, and coupled with the fact that I have not yet been able to finish my mod Bot Championship, I have decided to release it as a tutorial. Thus, here is <A HREF="tutorial/tourna.htm">tournament mode</A>. Hope you get some use out of it.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I've returned from my holiday break and realized that the earth has not exploded, I will continue my updates to this page. Coming up is a series of lessons on bot teamplay. Please check back soon. Thanks.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most controversial of the Tutor Bot is that he jumps into lava and slime. While some would say this underscores his simplistic nature, others might say it points to his brave view on life. Some may suggest that he possesses suicidal tendencies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, today brings us a solution: the <A HREF="tutorial/lava_bug.htm">no more jumping into lava or slime</A> tutorial. The title may not be elegant, but the content is oh-so-useful.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, I am still constructing my "Unfinished Mods" page as well as trying to finished said mods and write more tutorials. Lots more coming up.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got a different sort of lesson for you today. It allows players and bots to <A HREF="tutorial/drop_wep.htm">drop their current weapon</A> and ammo. That way, teammates can pick them up if they need them.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I have to admit, the Cafe message board is a pretty darn cool place. Yeah, it gets a bit silly, but there are some groovy ideas there. I'd love to play a Quake 1 version of <B>Jailbreak</B>, as well as a <B>Pac-Man</B> mod and <B>Rob The Nest</B>. I'm keeping my eyes open for them.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suppose a good idea would be for me to add a "Help Wanted" section to the board; I see many different people talking about mods, people who should probably be working together. Modmakers of the world unite!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a similar vein, I may create an "Unfinished Mods" page here, which would feature, oddly enough, information and screenshots of all my unfinished mods. I have four major ones which are from 60 to 80 percent done; I just need to decide which one is the most interesting to finish first. Perhaps I should let you the public vote on that, huh?<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have only a tutorial today, one which was written by <a href="mailto:koolio@botepidemic.com">Koolio</A>, author of the world-famous <a href = "http://www.botepidemic.com/koolio">KoolioBot</A>. This one will teach you how to code <A HREF="tutorial/locdam.htm">locational damage</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't test it yet, but it looks pretty cool. Everybody wants to be a sniper, you know. I'll be back with bot news and an editorial as soon as possible.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup, it has been a little while since my last posting, but I'm here again. And I have a great lesson for you, the second in my Holy Trinity of AI tutorials. You know how good bots like the Reaper and Omicron are able to chase you around corners and through teleporters, thereby killing you when you are wounded?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, <A HREF="tutorial/chasing.htm">today's tutorial</A> will give your bot that skill. It's true. Now he will be able to hunt and kill his foes even when they are trying to get away. You have to do this one.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other news, there are a few great new Quake projects going on, a couple of which I mentioned on my front page. Quake is several years old now, yet we are seing major conversions and bots being introduced even still. To be honest, I'm excited to play some of them.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of new projects, I do still plan to finish a bot mod one of these months. Time is obviously tight for me (girlfriend, job-hunting, relocation), but I vow to release a bot sport. Or bot sports.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This allow your bots to "win games" when and if he scores the number of points set in your "fraglimit" console variable. The lesson is only one line long, yet is rather significant.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, today I have revealed the first details of my unfinshed mod <B>Bot Championship</B>, which may or may not be similar to Quake 3: Arena. I have mixed feelings about the game. You can read about it on the <A HREF="http://minion.planetquake.gamespy.com/ubb/Ultimate.cgi">message board</A> in the Bot Ideas forum, then give your own opinions. I may or may not release it, depending on your feedback.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the jealous, aggressive, competitive-minded louse I am, I've noticed that <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/cronos/">CronosBots 1.06</A> and <A HREF="http://www.mdqnet.net/dept187/">FrikBot 0.08</A> as well as <A HREF="http://www.conversions.net/elf/">ElfBot 4.0</A> have all been released. Are the bot wars heating up yet again? Do we really know which is the best bot out there now?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skinski introduces us to the new "Radioactive" game mode in <A HREF="tutorial/radio.htm">today's tutorial</A>. It features a rarely-seen particle effect that id software forgot to use, and I quite enjoyed it.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other news, I just picked up the long-in-coming Quake 2 for the Sony Playstation. Is was supposed to feature split-screen deathmatch, Capture the Flag, and even -- gasp! -- bots. Did it end up delivering all this? I'll have a review soon.<P>

Remember that this is only my simple, QuakeC-minded take on a rather academic AI subject. So maybe Ingebrigt will write back and correct me on this one too.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been lots of bots released lately. It has amazed me. I keep checking my Bot Ideas forum and news sites like Bot Epidemic, and they just keep coming.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, does that mean we need to have inter-bot competitions soon? At least someone out there should compile a list of next-generation Quake Bots (ones which have come out in the last year or so). We could browse them more easily that way. That would be superb.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I bring you the first of the three best lessons ever. It covers <A HREF="tutorial/strafing.htm">strafing into items during battle.</A> Yeah, it's true; I finally pulled it off. This is one of my best AI routines. I do hope you like it. The new method made my bot a good bit tougher to kill.<BR> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In personal news, I just bought a new car, and things are going very well with my girlfriend. They both have taken up a good bit of time, which is why you haven't seen as many tutorials as before.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to write the other two best lessons (and others) this weekend, and release them sometime soon. Then I hope to move into the next phase of the series, the bot sport. There we will actually be applying our AI knowledge, getting your bot playing a game. Will it will be a ball-based game? A map-oriented mod? A Capture the Flag variant? All are possible, but you'll have to wait to see.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See, I told you guys I didn't really know fuzzy logic: I got the following email which explains that AI subject very well (and I want to thank the author for correcting me) ...<P> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! I read your article in the AI cafe about fuzzy logic, and I think it is a nice article that goes a long way towards explaining general concepts and usefulness of fuzzy logic.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, I don't think you are quite on target on the actual implementation. (I don't blame you, the scientific community aren't always very clear when they try to get a message trough to us "normal" people)  What you are doing, is making the bot more "random", i.e. acting in accordance with a probability distribution  that's great, but not really fuzzy logic. It's just fuzzy.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you're really doing in your example, is creating a (kinda) fuzzy VARIABLE. -- danger.  What you should be doing is create the same variable, and then use it much the same way you use a bool variable To do that you must define what makes danger true and false. (EX: say 0 is false, 20 is true, and a linear distribution of true/false in between) THEN you use it: if (danger is 95% true) { bla bla } etc. Now the real point comes when you have many such fuzzy variables. Then you do stuff like:<P>
if (drunk && itsDark && noPoliceNear && nearStreetCorner && haveToPiss is 90% true) then piss in the street  (of course, here you have to use fuzzy logic operators, which are easy to learn, but not same as boolean logic operators).  Usually, you'll also want to add a random function somwhere, like:  if (drunk && itsDark && noPoliceNear && nearStreetCorner && haveToPiss > random(0,1)) then piss in the street.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, its probably much better explained <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/faqs/ai/fuzzy/part1/faq-doc-2.html">at this site</A>, it really helped me. Btw, I've been using fuzzy logic on bots for some time now, and its very easy & clean, and it works great. (sorry I can't send you any code, property of the company, you know how it is ;) ). Also, I'd like to say tanx for all the effort you and others put into bots, it's been a help, keep up the good work.<P>
Cheers,<P>Ingebrigt<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well well, I finally make it make to my computer. I apologize for not updating in some time, but real life has taken a real upswing for me. Not to worry, I have more stuff for you coming soon in the future.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now I have a simple tutorial on <A HREF="tutorial/language.htm">bot language</A>. Yeah, it might be a lame lesson to offer you after several weeks of absence, but I do have others in progress.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, I have what I call the "Holy Trinity" of Tutor Bot lessons arriving in a short while. These will be the three best tutorials ever; they will make the Tutor Bot very close to a "Version 2.0" intelligence level debated so hotly on the <A HREF="http://minion.planetquake.gamespy.com/ubb/Ultimate.cgi">message forum</A>. They comprise chasing enemies through teleporters, strafing into items during battle, and navigating via buttons, platforms, teleporters, etc.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three routines are actually in my unfinished <B>Bot Championship</B> mod, and they work extremely well. Indeed, I was impressed to see how smart and aggressive my bot became. Anyway, that's for the future.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn you guys.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tell you what, either some of you don't have as much sense of humor -- or as much imagination -- as I had hoped. My farting tutorial created an uproar, causing many of you to complain or ask me if I was running out of ideas. Huh.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just have to say a word about the tutorial series. Obviously, each lesson has code in it that might conflict with the others. The series was not intended to be an A to Z affair. That is, your not just supposed to do each and every tut when it's posted.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, I intended the series to be more of a buffet: take what you want, as much as you want, and leave what you don't want. After all, you'd be pretty silly merely to leap right into a tutorial without reading it or backing up your source code.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than that, I wanted each of your bots to be different. If everyone did all the lessons, we'd have a hundred exact Tutor Bot clones. Mix it up. Add other source code, different AI. And sometimes my lessons are just for silliness, just for you to learn raw code.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of silliness, today's tutorial is in that category. It gives your bot gas. Specifically, it teaches your bot <A HREF="tutorial/farting.htm">how to fart.</A> Don't like it? Just ignore it.<P>

	</TR></TABLE><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems as though I've updated a lot, but I guess I haven't. That's because I've been hard at work at several bot things. This includes vastly improving the Tutor Bot source code.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made quite a few breakthroughs in AI, including navigation by teleporters and platforms, strafing into items during battle, and more. That leads me -- and many of you -- to ask the question: "Will there be a Tutor Bot 2.0?"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, no.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at least, proably not. However, it's not impossible. What's more likely though is that these tutorials will go on getting better, more sophisticated.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, with all of the AI on my hard drive right now, I honestly believe the Tutor Bot can rival the other public project, the FrogBot (which I feel is a great but very limited, fiddly program). In time, in time.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of great AI, today's tutorial is rather good. It will teach your bot how to <A HREF="tutorial/circle.htm">circle strafe</A> like a professional game player. Later.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, almost too busy. I am getting quite active again. I have written a good number of lessons. I have also created a new section for this site.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last and certainly not least, I have been developing a couple of mods. Yup, that's right. Actually have a beta floating out there somewhere too. I will offer details when it/they are close to finished.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, I serve you with a tutorial written by SkinSki, which tackles the problem of <A HREF="tutorial/secret.htm">opening secret doors</A>. Yeah, you need to read it.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already added more goodies to the <A HREF="links.htm">Links page</A>. I have a feeling this is soon going to be a massive storehouse of bot accessories. I highly recommend exploring the urls there.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran across a groovy article at PlanetQuake called <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/articles/lessismore.shtm">Less Is More</A>. It discusses why many mods don't succeed due to the fact that they are usually too damn big. This one is a must-read for mod developers.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got a lesson for you too. It offers a technique for <A HREF="tutorial/alt_nav.htm">alternate navigation</A>. This may or may not be useful to you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a bunch of tutorials coming, too, including ones on rail guns, bot classes, finding teleporters, and even farting. Come back soon.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For quite some time now I have been trying to get a message out. I mention it in editorials. I talk about it on ICQ.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is, I don't need to tell you: Quake bots are more popular than ever. The signs are everywhere.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So instead of my writing another enthusiastic article, I have put together a new section for the AI Cafe. Basically it's a links page, but I think it is more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new section includes new player models, excellent deathmatch maps, development sites, and much more. In fact, I am planning on adding to the page regularly, so it becomes a definitive list for modern bot projects.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just can't believe all of the Quake 1 deathmatch maps and bot projects still being made (I found many new games myself when creating these links). You could download new levels and bots every week! Check em all out at the <A HREF="links.htm">Links page</A> now.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want this page to be the list for all Tutor Bot-based games, so if yours is not listed here, tell me at <A HREF="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com">coffee@planetquake.com</A>. Hope you enjoy.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got a tutorial for you as well, naturally. It's a short one, but pretty good. Teach your bot how to <A HREF="tutorial/flee.htm">flee when injured</A>. Until next time.<P>

		<TD WIDTH=20% ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR="A800A8">May 31</TD>
	</TR></TABLE><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's Memorial Day, and summer has officially begun. Damn. I hate summer. Too hot for me. I'd rather sip coffee in a cafe on a rainy, chilly day than swim at a public pool or something.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good news for today is that the Interference Bot by <A HREF="mailto:ArwingX@aol.com">Chris "ArwingX" Dozier</A> has finally been released. Arwing has put a lot of effort and talent into this project, and I know many of you have been anxious for it. Without further ado, you can download it at:<P>
<CENTER> <A HREF="http://tux.telefragged.com/download.pl?dir=telefragged/be/&filename=interbotdm79z.zip&dl=local">Interference Bot 7.9Z</A><P> </CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is neither your usual deathmatch bot nor your normal SP/COOP helper, but a new Quake experience. The Interference Bot is a monster bot, or mobot, similar to those found in Minion and Minion Arena.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a mobot, the Interference Bot has a few great advantages, include nondecaying weaponry, better ways of movement, and different styles of attack. It's not the same old thing.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably don't deserve to have any more fun than this, but there is more: Interference Bot Arena has also been released. This takes the whole idea of mobots one step further, applying them to the popular mod Rocket Arena. Get it at:<P>
<CENTER> <A HREF="http://tux.telefragged.com/download.pl?dir=telefragged/be/&filename=intarena.zip&dl=local">Interference Bot Arena</A><P> </CENTER>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of this mobot madness will likely keep you in the house for the whole summer. At least it's two more reasons for me to avoid the sun.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to Arwing for all his hard work. Visit my <a href="inter.htm">Interference Bot page</A> for details. Quake rules forever.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damn, I had one bucked up weekend. First I had crippling email problems, then my hard drive nearly crashed. I had to reinstall Windows again. I hate computers.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhow, a lot is going on in the bot world. Quake 3: Arena and Unreal Tournament may change the very face of gaming. But there's still plenty of user development happening.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, the Tutor Bot-based <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Fortress/7565/superman11.zip">SuPeRMan Bot</A> by (KSA)Tekken has just been released. Check it out or deal with the ramifications.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the indefatigable Harb!ngeR of Fish and SkinSki continue their series of Quake mods at <A HREF="http://www.storm-1.freeserve.co.uk">E.L.F. Quake Site</A>. There's a patch there called Catch the Shrimp which you gotta see.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of SkinSki, he has offered another lesson to us, this one on <A HREF="tutorial/aim.htm">adjusting aim</A> to avoid obstacles. Thanks, man, we appreciate it.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You sure had enough time to do that last homework assignment, so you better have finished it. In any case, the solution is finally here, and it's called <A HREF="tutorial/home4a.htm">Gambling Man deathmatch mode</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know this was only a homework project, but it's actually a game I like to play. Lots of drama to it. I like winning one hundred frags at a time. You should give it a try.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry that the lessons have kind of slowed down; I've been doing various things away from the computer, like watching movies (I highly recommend <B>Cube</B>) and playing Playstation games (I suggest <B>Ridge Racer Type 4</B>). But there are plenty more tuts coming.<P>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you figure out Gambling Man yet? That is the new deathmatch mode proposed in the last homework assignment. It's a game I enjoy playing, so I hope you completed it. If not, I'm going to make you wait a little more.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have a tutorial for you, one written by the magnanimous ZeO from the Bot Epidemic, and also author of the Square Bot. It covers <A HREF="tutorial/thumping.htm">thumping removal</A>, which is an issue for every bot out there. Read this or suffer the consequences.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, I added some missing code to the <A HREF="tutorial/r_arena.htm">Rocket Arena lesson</A>. Even though I do test most of the tuts, bugs do slip through sometimes. I do, however, recommend that you try to solve bugs yourself, because that can sometimes be the best way to learn.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, I think I am going to do one more map for the hush-hush Tutor Bot sport. There should be about six maps on release. Also, the mod should include multiple models for the ball and the goal, and perhaps player skins, for you to mix and match.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of notes: one, this lesson offers a simplified version of RA tuned for the Tutor Bot. Two, you may have to do some additional programming to make your bot play the game well. Three, RA was coded by David 'crt' Wright, who I really respect.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the tut is long but simple I think. I tested it, and it seems to work fine. If you detect any bugs, just send me some mail.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocket Arena is a really groovy mod, so I'm happy with this tutorial. Give it a look.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a bonus for all your hard work, I have a fun, non-AI lesson for you: <A HREF="tutorial/corpse.htm">gibbable corpses</A>. Blast those bot bodies into itty bitty chunks.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tutorial will probably be the one covering Rocket Arena. Obviously, that'll be a groovy one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other news, I heard that a HeadHunter Bot is back in the works. Cool.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 28 ... There is a poll over at the great site <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com">Bot Epidemic</A> concerning bot authoring. The question was: "If you had the knowledge required to, would you write a bot?"<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results were clear and positive. Some 61 percent said yes, they defintely would. Another 25 percent said it would be an interesting project, and seven percent said they'd give it some thought. Only a mere eight percent said they prefer to play them.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ha! This of course makes me happy. No wonder the Tutor Bot has been such a smash. So, for those of you who still feel apprehensive about QuakeC, I say give the bot a look. You may be surprised at how quickly you learn about bots.<P>

Then when I checked my box today, I found 11 emails! Whoa. I haven't received that many at one time in more than a year. Both this site and Quake are really rolling again. Thanks to all of you, that is.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, all that mail puts me way behind. I guess it's a good problem to have. So now I'm working on two bot games, the tutorials, and bot news. Anyway, enough of me.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Harb!ngeR of Fish tells me that the ELFBOt will soon be implemented into the <A HREF="http://www.storm-1.freeserve.co.uk/">Storm Quake mod here.</A> He says its like Killer Quake Pak, and includes a railgun. I'm there, dude.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ze0 of the <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com">Bot Epidemic</A> has released v0.1a of Square Bot over at <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/square">the Square Bot page</A>. That bots has so many features that it would make your modem slow down if I mentioned them here. Take a look.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shawn F has done a pretty damn good bot which you can find at <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/pa2/hellbot/">right here</A>. He is open to feedback as well. Cool.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are just itching to play new bot mods. Obviously, bots are now --finally-- hip, as companies like id software and Epic MegaGames know. But QuakeC is also hip again, and it's still the most fun way to program a bot.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we want to hear about your bot. I want to begin posting news about Tutor Bot mods. Moreover, if you do not have your own website nor the time to maintain one, I would like to host your bot here at the Cafe.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talk to <B>a lot</B> of coders on ICQ, and I know there are <B>a lot</B> or projects that aren't in the Quake news. There is no reason for this. Send in your <A HREF="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com ?subject=Bot News">bot news now</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to create a page here with links to all your bot mods and bot pages. And I was even considering a "Best Tutor Bot Mod Contest," so tell me what you think.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, I have a tut for you. With it <A HREF="tutorial/talking.htm">your bots will talk</A> as if they have a doctorate degree. Well ...<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other news, I'm holding off on my announcement a bit longer. Not because things are going badly, but because things are going well. Fixed the bug in the names tut. Also, believe it or not, I wrote a lesson on adding PaintBall to the bot! Great! Splat! Check back for that tomorrow.<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>March 9 ... Dear Coffee,  I think I\m being really stupid but I've been looking for the tutor bot for half an hour on your site but with no luck. Where do I download it?<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, will these tutorials teach someoone like me, who as no prior programming experience other than basic, how to make a bot?  Sorry if you're busy.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;email from Robes</I><P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I'm the really stupid one. I've been pushing the Tutor Bot for a month now, but I don't even have a link to it! Sorry. As you can see, he now has <a href="tutor.htm">a section</A> of his own. You can download it there or <A HREF="files/tutor.zip">here</A>.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the lessons help those with no coding experience? Good question. I don't know. If you study everything on the tutorials page, including the link to Inside3D, perhaps. The less knowledge you have, though, the more challenging it may be.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always grappled with this issue. I'd love to teach everyone QuakeC. But if I write extremely simple tuts, that takes away from the cooler AI stuff. I think it is one way or the other. Plus, there are literally hundreds of basic QuakeC lessons on the net.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I have a new tut, today, coincidentally enough. Interestingly, I didn't write it. So I have a special guest star.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was written my the talented <A HREF="mailto:mrtate@contaminated.net">Captain Snark</A>, who seems to change his nickname every month. It's on a better <A HREF="tutorial/names.htm">bot naming system</A>. Thanks, Captain.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 6 ... It's an important day for your bot. Today is the day he shows up on the Quake scoreboard.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have posted the <A HREF="tutorial/ranking.htm">bots on scoreboard tutorial</A>. And I guarantee satisfaction or your money back. That is, it's been tested, it works, and it's stone-cold cool.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now your bot is big and bad and on the board. So where do we go from here, you ask? Further, of course. Not only do I have more lessons like railgun, rocket jumping, and running for cover, but I have a major announcement concerning bots and bot games coming soon.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I announced it now, I could cause mass chaos in the streets. So you'll just have to check back soon.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later February 27 ... Yup, two updates in one day. I just had to come back with this one: Bomb Squad.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's right, the <A HREF="tutorial/squad.htm">Bomb Squad</A> tutorial is out. It's a new deathmatch mode in which the bots drop bombs that you have to defuse. I tested it, and it works well.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of bugs, the <A HREF="tutorial/coop.htm">coop lesson</A> was really a mess; I fixed it and added to it, and it looks good. Check it out.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just because I didn't do much updating the past week, i wrote a bonus tutorial for you. It's shows you how to make a <A HREF="tutorial/botcam.htm">bot camera</A>. That is, you can see what the bot sees. I tested it too, and it works well. Easy, too.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next tut will put bots on the scoreboard.<P>

February 20 ... Today's tutorial is another simple one. It deals with how to <A HREF="tutorial/coop.htm">add co-op support</A> to your bot in case you want to see him shoot monsters.<P>
I had planned to have something more exciting for you, but I've been busy this week. I promise to hang in there if you do.<P>
Anyway, you just gotta see the bots-on-scoreboard and "Bomb Squad" lessons. They'll be worth the wait. Hehe.<P>

Hey, I fixed a potential bug in the <A HREF="tutorial/last_man.htm">Last Man Standing</A> lesson. I added a little something to the look_for_others() routine. Speaking of bugs, if you are getting a stack overflow problem with your Tutor Bot, it's likely coming from the routine bot_set_currentammo(). You'll notice that the grenade launcher is missing from that; you have to make a section for it.<P>
I uploaded a new tutorial as well, one on <A HREF="tutorial/choice.htm">weapon preferences</A>. It's very easy. More coming this week.<P>

February 14 ... I meant to update before now, but I've been busy with many things. One, I'm still improving my deathmatch sport called <B>Run</B>, and it's looking good. Thanks go out to Godhead for his creative input.<P>
Two, I've been writing tutorials. Yeah, I know, you're thinking that there don't seem to be that many. But that's because I've been busy writing them! In fact, I have more than five written now, including a new deathmatch mode called "Bomb Squad." I am testing them more strictly than before, because of the recent bugs.<P>
I have one covering <A HREF="tutorial/coffee.htm">better navigation</A> right now. I'm working on the scoreboard lesson as we speak.<P>
Three, I am working on the cool Tutor Bot game; I can't divulge too much info now, but just remember that my lessons will culminate in a big, fun project.<P>
And four, I've been playing Paroxysm. It's actually a damn good combo mod. Frank did a great job improving the Tutor Bot. You should check it out.<P>

February 10 ... Hey. Lots for you today. First, I corrected the errors in the <A HREF="tutorial/items.htm">bot items</A> lesson. Sorry about those; that was a friggin hard tut to write. Everything should be okay with it now.<P>
Next, I have a really fun tutorial teaching you and the bot how to play the deathmatch game <A HREF="tutorial/last_man.htm">Last Man Standing</A>. I like that. It was pretty simple.<P> 
I've always thought that every mod should have a bot. I've also thought that the Tutor Bot could be a great utility for you mod-makers out there. I just received an email that reinforces my feelings. Thanks to Frank and everyone else who has been sending me mail lately. Check this out:<P>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

Hello,<P>

First off, I'd like to thank you for releasing the Tutor bot. I was working
on a Single player Quake mod until I got a hold of your source code. Now it
Deathmatch/Botmatch only!<P>

I'm releasing a public beta of my mod tommorrow (Feb.7, between 12:00am -
2:00am EST) I beleive this is the first mod to be released that uses a bot
based on your code.<P>

I've already implement attack styles (I just noticed your new tutorial),
true item/weapon usage, ranking, skill level, and have modified the roaming,
ledge detection and water detection (among other things).<P>

The mod (called Paroxysm) features 6 new weapons (with secondary triggers),
Regen stations (for armour) and numerous additons (like footsteps, rotating
bsp models, all new console graphics, new sounds...). The best part about
the mod is that it is compatible with all existing deathmatch maps.<P>

I just thought I'd let you know. Paroxysm website <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/paroxysm/">http://www.planetquake.com/paroxysm/</A>. Thanks again!<P>

Frank C.<P>

February 8 ... Got a lot done since yesterday. First, I made this page and some of my others look good in Netscape Navigator (it really looked like crap; you guys should've told me!). For better or worse, I use Explorer, so I'm not always aware of that.<P>
Next I wrote not one but two excellent tutorials. Your bot will really get tricky with these. One, we teach the bot to throw <A HREF="tutorial/backpack.htm">exploding backpacks</A>. And two, we teach him how to <A HREF="tutorial/playdead.htm">play dead</A>. How cool is that?<P>
Third, I've been working with a couple guys on graphics, logos, and perhaps even a --gasp!-- redesign for this page. I'm still skeptical right now; most of the web has redesign fever, and I don't want to just blindy jump on the bandwagon. We'll see.<P>

February 7 ... Back again. I hope you can tell I'm dedicated to the Tutor Bot. I'll tell you a secret: all the tutorials are leading up to something big!<P>
I have yet another important tutorial. It really complements the waypoint lesson. This one allows the bot to <A HREF="tutorial/items.htm">pick up items for real</A>. That is, he will actually touch and collect different items.<P>
It's a long tutorial, but very important. The Tutor Bot will pretty much be a real bot after this.<P>
I also fixed the bugs in the Predator Mode tutorial. Sorry about those. Thanks to DJ for noticing.<P>
While I'm at it, thanks to Enthropy, Zeo, ArwingX, Twinkysaurus and the rest of the ICQ bunch for their support. They make it all worth it.<P>

<B>Special Note:</B> Yes, there were two bugs in the waypoint tutorial. One dealt with the waypoint list printing, the other dealt with the bot clearing his waypoint values when respawning. I fixed those. Sorry for the inconvience.<P>

February 6 ... Man, I just can't keep up with everything I want to do. I have so many ideas for tutorials, articles, news and more. There's a lot going on with me ... and the Quake One community in general, I'm glad to say.<P>
I do have waypoint improvement lessons coming up. I also have a new deathmatch game tutorial based on the waypoints. In addition, I'll do a tut on how to make the bot pick up items for real. I'll try to keep up as much as I can.<P>
Naturally I have an excellent tutorial for you. And once more, your bot will do things with it that no other bot does: <A HREF="tutorial/fight.htm">attack in different fighting styles</A>. It's a must-see. Check back when you can. Coffee out.<P>

January 31 ... It is here, the tutorial that you've been waiting for: <A HREF="tutorial/waypoint.htm">waypoint support</A>. Now you can make your bot roam any level perfectly, make him go anywhere you want. It's true, and it works.<P>
Both the FrogBot and the Omicron use waypoints. Now your bot can travel just as efficiently as them. This makes for many applications and for much potential.<P>
The tutorial is a bit longer than the rest, but obviously it is worth learning. Honestly, it's much simpler than you think. And there are even better lessons to come. Keep checking in.<P>
Also, I want to thank Ze0 at the <A HREF="http://www.botepidemic.com/">Bot Epidemic</A> for the kick in the ass to get this tut finished.<P>

It's been a long time coming, but the Tutor Bot has finally arrived.<P>
This program is a cool deathmatch bot that comes in just one file. The QuakeC is short and easy to understand.<P>
So, you can plug him into other mods. Or you can examine the code to see how bots work and even customize it to your liking.<P>
I hope that you will take him and combine him with popular mods like Starship Quake or Headhunters. If not, you can follow my tutorials to add modes like Last Man Standing and more.<P>
The Tutor Bot travels maps extremely well. He uses all of Quake's weapons. He attacks you in various ways. He even understands teamplay.<P>
Anyway, download the 146K <A HREF="files/tutor.zip">Tutor Bot</A> now!<P>
Or check out his "duck" tutorial <A HREF="tutorial/main.htm">right here</A>. Enjoy.

Coffee, I have been looking at your site since it opened, and I am amazed ...
blah blah blah ... alright, let's get to the point here.<P>
I thought Requiem for Q1
was an awesome single player mod ... but it wasn't developed fully ... it wasn't as ...
ya know ... refined.  There were some bugs that were irritating, and the bots
didn't actually learn very well. They did the same things over and over.<P>
You personally could revive Q1 from a premature death ('cuz of Q2). If you could make the
monster bot more like "Artificial Intelligence" instead of "Toilet Bowl Intelligence."
Alright, alright, what have i done? I made a fiend attack other monsters for fun.
It's pitiful, I know, but your site is a step in the right direction, just all too
late, no one cares about Q1 anymore. Especially single player.<P>
Okay, okay! I know
i'm getting preachy again! Sorry, i just wish it could've been different for Q1 ...
so much potential, but a squandered youth ... Just keep on doing what you're doing
and maybe some more of us will see the light at the end of the enforcer's
blaster one more time ...<P>

There's a bot deathmatch sport sitting on my hard drive. It includes about 10 exclusive maps. It features two teams, one ball, and one goal. It focuses on a gameplay style that is, how can I say this, fast.<P>
It's called <B>Run</B>. I ceased work on it about a month ago, because I had mixed feelings about it.<P>
But I've received a bunch of great compliments about it, both then and now. If you want to playtest the first version, send me a message through ICQ at 2716002.<P>

Quake is dead? Blasphemy! Hang that man upside down for a week!<P>
No, Quake will live as long as the last person who remembers it, which is to say it will never die. Speaking of death, I'm not dead. I just look that way.<P>
It's quite disrespectful of me to go without updating for so long and not offer an explanation. But as we all know, Real Life is not fair.<P>
I've been busy with getting a new job, finding a place to live. You know, stupid shit. I've actually been balancing this and my Quake career for a year now. I think I've done fairly well for the most part, but I'm getting overwhelmed.<P>
Anyway, I will try to keep updating and developing, but I may be erratic until a settle into a new job. I do have a gift for you now, though.<P>
My present is the most important AI tutorial so far: <A HREF="tutorial/tutor9.htm">how to spawn a monster.</A> That's right, now you can create a creature in any map. And it's not that hard.<P>
Also, I'll be releasing my plug-in bot with source code soon. Stay tuned.<P>

Hey everybody. Just wanted to tell you I have been in Washington DC, so that's why I haven't updated.<P>
I have several new tutorials written, including Make Your Own Monster Bot. I will post them soon, maybe even today.<P>
Plus, I have a new program being released soon. Stay tuned.<P>

I posted up an important tutorial today; it's the coolest yet. It will teach you how to program a <A HREF="tutorial/tutor8.htm">helper monster</A>, a demon who will follow and protect you.<P>
With the ideas in that lesson, you could build a neat coop patch where creatures fight with you. Check it out.<P>
I want to thank Fruchle and |Raptor| for the great work they are currently doing for me. They are talented guys. Everyone we'll soon see what we're working on ...<P>

As you can see, I'm trying out new names for this site. I want it to relate more to AI. This one was suggested by my colleague SockMan over at <A HREF="http://www.botauthors.org/">Bot Authors' Guild.</A> What do you think?<P>
I'm trying to catch up on my mail; I am answering questions about the lessons. Speaking of those, I did a new one for QuakeC virgins, so <A HREF="tutorial/tutor7.htm">take a look</A>. It comes complete with links to QuakeC and a compiler.<P>
I've have much coming out soon, including monster lessons and bot source code, plus a couple mods.<P>

Wow, an editorial and news on the same day; what more could you ask for. Huh, what's that? You want a new tutorial as well? Okay, you got it.<P>
Yes, I've posted a new AI lesson on how to add <A HREF="tutorial/tutor4.htm">night time mode</A> to Quake and to any deathmatch bots. Rather cool. More to come soon.<P>

The <a href="tutorial/main.htm">Tutorials Section</A> is open! Alright, now we're talking. I have posted the first three lessons, plus a bunch of other helpful material.<P>
This is big news for me, and I hope you too. I've wanted to do AI lessons for a while now. I want more people to be able to program smart monsters and deathmatch bots.<P>
If you have any questions or would like to see a certain tutorial, <B>please</B> feel free to contact me at <A HREF="mailto:coffee@planetquake.com">coffee@planetquake.com</A>. I do take requests.<P>
I hope you enjoy the series.<P>

Hey people. Been working hard this week. I have started my series of artificial intelligence tutorials for QuakeC.<P>
That's right, soon you'll know how create your own mobots and make your own deathmatch bots. I have about five lessons written, and there are many more to come. I hope to post the first three very soon.<P>
