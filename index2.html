It's time for a baserush! The TFBots has arrived, so you better build a sentry gun and station your snipers on the deck. They turned out really well, so I hope you get a chance to download them. Let me mention a few features to entice you:<P>

* a new game mode called FortBall. A ball spawns in the middle of the map, and you have to run it into the enemy fort to score a touchdown<BR>
* you can adjust the skill and speed of the bots<BR>
* one of my modes, Sabotage, plays like Quake 3 Team Arena's Overload, in which you have to 
destroy the enemy's base generator<BR>
* the maps include classics like bam4 and canyon1 and lesser known works like fort0rz2 and cryptic1<BR>
* you can play any of the six modes on virually all of the 24 maps, so can have fresh experiences all the time<BR>
* a menu that comes up after each match, where you can easily select your next game mod and map<P>

You will have to download 3 files to play:<P>
