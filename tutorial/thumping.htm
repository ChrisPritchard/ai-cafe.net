<p><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello.
I'm Ze0, i'll make the introduction short and sweet.. I wrote
this tutorial because of everything that Coffee has done for me
has changed the way I think and feel about many things including
life itself. And I thought i'd just do something to show my
thanks for all he has done for me. Now, on with the lesson.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this lesson you will
stop the Tutor Bot from making those annoying thumping sounds as
he jumps. This lesson has no coding in it so it is fairly simple.
I know you all know of the dreaded thumping sound which a lot of
bots, including the Reaper, make as they jump.
There is an easy way to fix this. It involves creating a .wav
file which has no sounds and various other things. Lets get
started..</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a directory off of
your Tutor Bot directory and call it &quot;Sound&quot; (without
the quotes of course..) then in that Sound directory make another
directory called &quot;Demon&quot; (again without the quotes) now
you need to open up your favourite sound editing program (mine
being Microsoft Sound Recorder :)) and create a new sound.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save
it as soon as you create it as dland2.wav into the directory we
just created. And that is all there is too it! Your directory
structure should look something like this:</font></p>

<p><font color="#DFBFFF" size="3" face="System">c:\quake\tutorbot\sound\demon\dland2.wav</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="MS Sans Serif">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you did everything
right according to the lesson then boot up your Tutor Bot and
watch him jump up and down and listen to the sounds of silence..
But don't watch him for too long otherwise he just might kill you
:)</font></p>
