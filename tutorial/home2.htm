&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, not another one!<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I have another homework assignment for you. In fact, this is second in what will become a short series. I can hear hissing and booing again. At least I won't send you to detention.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's easy just to copy my lessons into your bot. But I do feel that it is important for you to try your hand at specific tasks. You will be a much better bot programmer after these short projects.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assignment: in teamplay mode, allow the player to tell his bot teammates to camp or roam.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoa, cool. Are you up to it? I know your are. Besides, this is easy to accomplish. Indeed, I chose it specifically because it doesn't take much work.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's that, you need a clue? Oh well, okay. If you don't want any clues, you can leave now. If you do, just take a look at the bot's standing and walking AI subroutines. Plus, you may need to use an impulse command and the findradius() function.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good luck. May the force be with you.<P>
