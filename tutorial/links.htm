One of the best sites on artificial intelligence in all games. Though it can get a bit technical, it is likely the most simple out of all others.<P>

I hope you've seen this site before; it's the premier QuakeC tutorial site. I learned QuakeC here. I *strongly* recommend doing their lessons before you do mine.<P>

Probably the best Quake-related intelligence site. It focuses on client-side bots, but it has a section on algorithms and a good message board. Look for this to grow.<P>

This is another all-around great bot site, with lots to look at. There's a lot of information, news, and even source code here. It's also the home of the DarkBot and SABIN Project.<P>

This is the QuakeC directory at Cdrom.com. You can dive in and swim around the cool patches and source code here. Check it out, dammit.<P>

Whoa, this directory is packed with good stuff. There's a bot for every occassion, and plenty of source to boot. Will your bot be here someday?<P>
