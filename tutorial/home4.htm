&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, we have reached the last -- and the best -- homework assignment. In the last, we learned how to allow the player to "buy" weapons. Today we will take the idea of frags as money one step further.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assignment: allow the player to bet on whether he will win or lose a battle. For instance, he can set a wager, and he will win this value if he wins the next fight, or lose it if he loses the fight.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can nickname this unique deathmatch mode Gambling Man, or maybe High Stakes, or maybe Risky Business. Heehee. I'm kind of proud of this idea, to tell you the truth. It can add a level of risk and thrill that may now be lacking from vanilla deathmatching.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the maximum value for a wager is the player's frags, since that is his money. The minimum should be one, because a battle has to mean something.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see the player setting his wager high when he gets the rocket launcher and low when he has the axe. I can see a player earning dozens of frags quickly and then losing them all instantly after a high stakes battle.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like before, you can ignore the bot for now. Hey, if you can make him wager, have fun. But as a lover of bots, even I still realize that the player is the star of the game. Plus, if the bots did wager, it would drastically lessen the thrill for the player.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, you have homework to do, so I'll let you get to it.<P>
