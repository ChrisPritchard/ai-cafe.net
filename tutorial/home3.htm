<CENTER>Homework Assignment No. 3</CENTER>

<P>&nbsp;<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have the third homework assignment. I suppose this is a good time to tell you that these assignments are a part of one series which will result in a unique new deathmatch mode. So, if you think they are kind of silly, just hang in there.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will definitely challenge you more than the first two. But when you get it, you will truly know that you are on the path to being a true bot master.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assignment: when a player touches a weapon, he will not get it unless he has enough money. And his money is his frags. In other words, he must buy weapons with frags. But if he does not have enough frags, he will not be able to afford the gun.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty funky, huh? I thought so. I think this "Money Quake" mode will add a bit of depth to deathmatch. It will be worth a challenge to you.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you confused? Just like the previous homework projects, this is simpler than you may think.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: forget about the bots for now. That is, the bots will be able to get any weapons they want. If you really want them to pay for the guns, fine, go for it. But that's not a part of the assignment. That makes it considerably easier.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to nudge you along, here are some recommended "prices" for each weapon:<P>

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="DFBFFF" FACE="System">
	super shotgun			1 frag
	nailgun				1 frag
	perforator			2 frags
	grenade launcher		3 frags
	thunderbolt			4 frags
	rocket launcher			5 frags
</FONT>
</PRE>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can make them higher, but don't want it to be too hard or frustrating for the player. He already has to "save up" for a good weapon.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish you luck. My solution will come in a while.<P>
