&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a long time coming, but I've finally managed to get all those broken links to my previous mods fixed. I should have done it sooner, but, well, you know.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now <a href="http://dl.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?minion/sky.zip">SkyBlazer</A>, <a href="http://dl.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?minion/minion.zip">Minion</A>, and <a href="http://dl.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?minion/holy_tb.zip">HolyWar TutorBot</A> are available after about two years in limbo. As a bonus, I've even thrown in <a href="http://dl.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?minion/fugitive.zip">Fugitives in Fragtown</A>, my very first mod, which has been completely unavailable until now.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please remember that these are pretty oldschool projects, done a long time ago a simpler, bygone era, when we were all giddy with QuakeC glee. These titles don't really represent what I want to do as a mod designer; in fact, most of them were accidents. Oh well.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may have noticed that I left Minion Arena -- the best of my mods -- off that list. I hope to release that title in a week. I am considering a special edition, but I can't decide right now. Moreover, I hope to release a new mod (whoa) a week after that, so please keep checking back.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, click on the links or go to each mod page to download these files.<P>

		<TD WIDTH=20% ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=CENTER BGCOLOR="7700EE"><B>2K1</B></TD>
	</TR></TABLE><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been intending to update for some time now. But when I got news of EQuake, I knew the time had come. This is certainly the coolest Q1 news in quite a while.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, the entire Quake1 community would be given a chance to really become the center of attention of the Quake and gaming community at large," wrote CocoT, who came up with the idea. "The second, probably even more interesting goal is to motivate ourselves into building cool stuff for that expo. If there is only one week in a year's time when you'll be able to clearly show your talents to everyone, then this will be the one."<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, this is just what Q1 needs. After all this time, I still feel that QuakeC is the easiest and most fun way to create your own games. Quake 3 Arena may be five years newer, and it may very well be a good game, but it simply lacks QuakeC.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to write an article or an editorial for EQuake. I'd like to do a mini-mod as well. Of course, I haven't been very active in the Q-mmunity as of late, so we'll see how it goes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I have played through Unreal Tournament, TimeSplitters and Quake 3 Revolution -- all bot games for the Playstation 2 -- since I last update this site (that may explain my absence a bit, huh). They're all worth checking out if you are a console gaming fan.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plan to update again soon, so please do check back when you can. For now, head on over to <A HREF="http://www.inside3d.com">Inside3D</A> and post your support for EQuake. Remember, Quake lives forever.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Playstation 2 is now out, praise the lord, and it is good. Some 26 titles were released with Sony's new console, and surprisingly, many of them are must-buy games.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what does this have to do with the AI Cafe, you ask? For one, I'm interested in anything good, be it film, music or game. Secondly, because two of the launch titles, <B>TimeSplitters</B> and <B>Unreal Tournament</B>, focus on botmatches. And they're good. Real good.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most PC users scoff at consoles, or first-person shooters on consoles. But as an oldschool Quake fan, I can say this now: on October 26th, everything changed. These two shooters are great, and I expect to see many more on the PS2. I'll try to post reviews of them, as well as news on my new mod soon.<P>

	</TR></TABLE><P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I got your attention with that silly headline, I can honestly say the playtesting of my new mod, <B>Ballz</B>, is proceeding well. Been busy with that lately, so I don't have a big update for you today.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll try to have more for you next time, maybe a tutorial or game details and screenshots.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and check out my message board if you get the chance. There still is interesting talk going on there.<P>

<FONT size=2 face="Verdana" color="black">
<U><FONT COLOR="blue">What Price Survival</FONT></U><BR>Rustling leaves. Misty scenery. A beautiful Asian woman. Men in black suits having swordfights. This film proves that Hong Kong can still make a much more wistful action picture than Hollywood. If you like action with a soul, rent this movie.<P>&nbsp;<P>
<U><FONT COLOR="blue">Princess Mononoke</FONT></U><BR>Um, wow. Like watching a magic spell, this gorgeous film will captivate you as it did me. Not only is it the best anime movie since Akira, it was one of the best films of last year overall. Epic battles, gorgeous scenery, and wondrous spirits, this is a perfect candidate for DVD.<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A HREF="http://www.capcom.com">Resident Evil 2</A><BR>Put simply, a gothic masterpiece. Any self-respecting Quake fan who owns a Playstation should get this. Like playing a George Romero movie.<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ktel.com">Digital Empire:<BR>Drum n Bass Vol. 1</A><BR>One of the most original and intelligent forms of music in a long while, drum n bass kicks a whole lotta ass. This compilation from K-tel provides a solid introduction.<P>&nbsp;<P>
<A HREF="http://www.homepageofthedead.com">Home Page of the Dead</A><BR>I like zombies. Quake zombies are cool. But filmmaker George Romero does zombies best. This site pays tribute to his superb Dead trilogy.<P>&nbsp;<P>
