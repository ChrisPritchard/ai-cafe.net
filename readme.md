# AI Cafe, by Daryl 'Coffee' Atkinson

This site was formative in my youth, before I even had a computer of my own, so I wanted to make an archival copy of it.

Cloned via `wget -r https://www.quaddicted.com/webarchive/minion.planetquake.gamespy.com/`, as quaddicted also maintain a copy.

Have tried tracing 'Coffee', can't find him online anywhere. Its been 25 years I guess.
