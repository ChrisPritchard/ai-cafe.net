&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size=+3><B>T</B></FONT>wo monsters enter the arena. Only one comes out. And it won't always be you.<P></FONT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's time to present Minion Arena, a different kind of deathmatch contest for single players. Throw away your idea of what Quake is. Forget the notion that you are the only player that matters. Cross the line between single player and multiplayer.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the other side.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You play as a monster, but you don't always fight. A certain number of mobots, or monster bots, are spawned at the beginning of each game. Then two are chosen to enter the Arena, where they fight viciously to the death. You and the other monsters can watch and enjoy safely on the sidelines.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one fighter dies, he is teleported back to the observation area. Another contestant is selected, and he tries to defeat the reigning champion. Inevitably, your time will come to enter the arena. You will win or die: there is no escape.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you can watch a tarbaby use his bounce attack on a vore, who will strafe out of the way. You can watch a spider try to sting an ogre, who will drop a pipebomb and flee.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, you can interact with the mobots who are watching. They will talk to you, tell you cheat codes, even recommend other Quake mods. They'll pivot towards the fighters and run around to get a better view. And they will jump in excitement when a fighter dies.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you don't just chat with these bots for fun: sometimes, if they like you, they will cast a heal spell or a morph spell on you. On top of that, they may teach you any number of magic spells for use in battle. So, the more you interact, the better you will be as a fighter.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're monster enough to win a tournament, you morph into a new creature. The contest begins again. If none of the mobots topple you, you will attain another morph. But believe me when I say, the other creatures don't want to see this happen.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think this sounds like <A HREF="http://www.planetquake.com/servers/arena/">Rocket Arena</A>, you're right. That cool game was my inspiration, and I thank its maker, David Wright. Of course, I put a twisted spin on his mod.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, I want us single players to get a deeper experience from games. I'm tired of reading about a groovy new mod ... for internet play only. As a solo gamer, I find Minion Arena to be fun to play. Period.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a game for people who love artificial intelligence, for people who are tired of the same old thing. Each monster bot has his own multiple attacks -- just like your morphs -- while each observing mobot has something different to say and do.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the winner gets to fight. The losers have to watch. Minion Arena has arrived. The status quo has left.<P>
