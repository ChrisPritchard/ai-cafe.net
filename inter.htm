The Interference Bot
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P></U></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The arena is as dark as a demon's shadow.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wait, muscles trembling, eyes
wide open in the darkness of a place unknown to you. Suddenly, you here a
strange sound, similar to that of air-displacemeant. You come out of your
shadow to see what is wrong, to the avail of seeing nothing.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, you
morph into a fiend, so you can get around better. You jump from ledge to
ledge, scanning the arena for any type of life until BAM! The screen turns
white from an explosion that formed beneath you as you fly into the ceiling.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your health is now at 50. While falling, you look up to see a lightning bolt
just missing you, and you turn your head ... a shambler is charging in at full
speed to finish the kill. Just as the hideous machination lifts his arm to
send your soul flying from this world, you  leap to your feet and bound off in
an incredible jump.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You flee for your life as you hear lightning booms and
feet pounding. You morph into a zombie to heal yourself together before that
hideous abomination finds you again. This is your life as a monster morpher.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is your experience with the Interference Bot.<P>
&nbsp;<P>

They're Mobots
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P></U></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interference Bot is neither your usual DM Bot, nor your usual SP/COOP
bot, but an entire Quake experience. You see ... the Interference Bot, unlike
99.9999% of all Quake bots(excluding Cujo and Larva), is a monster bot, or
mobot as my mentor Coffee would tell ya.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a monster bot, the interference
bot has a few great advantages. Some advantages include nondecaying weaponry,
better ways of movement, and different styles of attack. (Monster bots ALSO
take ten times more work to code than "human" bots, and thus usually end up
being more pleasing to the creator ... hehehe ...)<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In DM, 12 monster classes are supported for monsters. These classes are
scrag, vore, spawn blob, hell knight, regular knight, grunt, enforcer, ogre,
shambler, shalrath, fiend, and snakeman. A spawned monster starts out in one
class and converts to another after it dies. The player, on the other hand, is
given 13 classes, which he/she can freely switch between at will.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are
shambler, hell knight, scrag, vore, zombie, fiend, ogre, snakeman, enforcer,
tarbaby, spider. The player himself only starts out at 100 health, but
switches to 150 health when he or she takes a monster form. Like players,
mobots also start out with 150 health.<P> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In SP, all 13 player classes are supported, as well as another feature. When
you spawn a monster in coop or SP, it becomes part of your team, and shares
your colors. They don't attack monsters at will, because they're friendly.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular monsters WILL however attack them as well as you, making them then
VERY violent. Your monster team members also get violent at whoever attacks
you ... true guard dogs, to say the least.<P>

They Don't Just Hate Players
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<P></U></FONT>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Interference Bot which will do just about anything
to stop you from reaching the fraglimit. The monsters however aren't limited to hating
players. Sometimes you might see them attacking each other or holding into
little hordes, chatting. Either way you find em, you can earn frags by killing
these suckers.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, if ya want to join up with a pal to race to a fraglimit,
just start up the enclosed client bot before you start the DM for even more
fun. The bots can do just about anything, including jumping, swimming, and
straifing somewhat like real players.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes ... if you don't feel like deathmatching as a human,
just use one of the 14 morphs against those wicked monsters. If you don't feel
like deathmatching at all, don't worry one bit. The SP mode is just as challenging.
Just start er up on easy and see for yourself.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mix single player and deathmatch. Add monsters and intelligence. Pour in excitement and a little fear. Stir. What you've got is the Monster Mash 2 DM Interference Bot, availible soon only at the AI Cafe.<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's gonna get monstrous around here.<P>
&nbsp;<P>
