Yes, you read correctly, this one file acts as an almost-fully functional bot that you can easily plug into deathmatch patches and mods. Or you can customize him and create new games by following the tutorials <A HREF="tutorial/main.htm">right here</A>. The lessons are easy and fun.<P>

The Tutor Bot travels maps extremely well. He uses
all of Quake's weapons. He attacks you in various ways. In
addition, he understands teamplay.<P>
He is called the Tutor Bot because you can learn how
a deathmatch bot works with him. The programming is made to be
short and simple. It is not made to be the smartest bot.<P>
This source code contains many remarks explaining the
subroutines. This code, and the tutorials as well, are written
in simple, brief language. This is a public project.<P>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

Here are the major artificial intelligence routines.
I didn't explain all of them, nor did I explain his animation
and weapons code. That's just technical stuff. You should know
what all that stuff looks like, but you don't need to
understand each line.<P>


bot_search_for_items() He checks all the entities within 1500
units of where he's standing. He'll search for an
item for 30 seconds.<P>

bot_grab_items() This is one of the secrets of the Tutor Bot's
success. He doesn't actually touch an item; if he's
close enough to his goalentity, he just pretends to
pick it up by making it invisible. He will also mark
that item not to look for it again for 60 seconds.<P>

check_for_water() The Quake engine doesn't know when bots are
in water, so he has to check a spot in front of him
to see if it's water, slime or lava. He swims by
upward velocity, or speed.<P>

check_for_ledge() The id function movetogoal() will avoid
ledges, so again we must check a point in front of him
to see if it's air. If so, he jumps.<P>

bot_look_for_players() Copied from id's FindTarget(). He will
not make teammates into enemies.<P>

bot_look_for_bots() Bots are not clients, so he must look for
them manually. In fact, he looks at every bot to see
if they are in his site.<P>

bot_stand() Here is where he stands and turns a bit.<P>

coffee_move() Probably my most powerful subroutine. The bot will
run along walls and turn at their corners. He can travel
a long distance with this code. He only uses it when
he doesn't have a goalentity. The "self.button1" is a
variable I borrowed from id to hold his turning angle.<P>

bot_walk() He looks for players, bots and items here. If he has
a goal item, he'll move to it. If not, he'll run around.<P>

bot_run_slide() A cool strafing routine.<P>

bot_strafe() This allows him to move even while he is shooting.
He may strafe, duck, move forward, or back up, 
depending on his weapon. Ducking is optional.<P>

bot_run() He is fighting here. If he loses site of the player,
he'll give up. If the enemy is visible, he'll fire.<P>

give_random_weapon() The other secret of the Tutor Bot. You could
call this a cheat. Non-players aren't usually allowed
to touch items, so this subroutine keeps us from having
to change all that code. You can customize it, though.<P>

bot_bestweapon() Selecting the most powerful gun he has.<P>

bot_set_currentammo() Readying the proper ammunition.<P>

th_respawn() He's almost ready to be reborn.<P>

bot_pain() Happens when he's shot.<P>

bot_die() Making him into one dead bot.<P>

bot_attack() His central attack function, here he looks to see
what gun he's holding and what animation scene to play.<P>

respawn_bot() Putting him back into game, and making him
whole again.<P>

create_bot() Spawning an entity that will look, sound, act and
smell just like a player.<P>

Yes, there is a purpose to the Tutor Bot. I've been
fiddling with AI now for one year, but I've released only
a small fraction of the ideas in my head. I'm tired of being
one of the only Quake developers who works on deathmatch games
exclusively for single players. I want you to make me some.<P>

There are a load of neat patches on cdrom.com for
deathmatch play; the Tutor Bot could bring them to single
players. In addition, there are a ton of full-blown team mods
that are just begging for bots.<P>

I realize the Tutor Bot is simple, sometimes dumb. And
I'm sure you'll get a lot of weird results combining it with some
patches. But I wrote him to be simple and short, so you could
understand the code and change it if you want.<P>

I am planning a whole series of AI tutorials on how
to add special effects, weapons, improvement, and rules to
the Tutor Bot, so that will be fun too.<P>

I hope developers and first-time coders alike will
take this and enjoy it and make something great with it. Every
Quake mod should have a bot.<P>
